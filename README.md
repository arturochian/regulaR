#RegulaR
Regular expressions for humans, a port of Ruby's Regularity library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimhester/regulaR.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimhester/regulaR)

regulaR is a human friendly regular expression builder for R. While regular
expressions are a powerful way to match text, they are sometimes difficult to
document and understand when written.  R also has escaping issues with regular
expression this library hopes to solve.
